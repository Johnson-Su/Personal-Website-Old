# Personal Website
Hi! This is my responsive personal website where I post the projects that I do and the process behind it.

[Check it out!](https://sujohnson.com/)

## Future update plans
   •  Improve image resizing when window size changes<br/>
   •  Clean up my code, comment, and remove redundant classes <br/>
   •  Organize my files into folders <br/>
   •  Add different sized project cards to accomodate for more future projects 
   
## Something looks cool?
Feel free to use any portion of my code for developing your own website! 
If possible I would appreciate some attribution if you are publishing it :)
